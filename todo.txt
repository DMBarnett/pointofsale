##Fix history.price to take float, need to rebuild DB

Fix bug:
  When switching sets on user page, deleting an item from another set causes an error
  When switching sets, if an item is selected, when switching back to the initial set it wont reduce the quantity available for purchase
  Record price sold at in history as a float
  Add card name to history
  

##Make item buttons disable when quantity === 0 

##reduce this.state.total when items are deleted
